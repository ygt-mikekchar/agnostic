Agnostic is a Vim colour scheme geared towards helping people who
use tmux to remote pair program.  When doing such pair programming
it often happens that each person has a preference for colour
schemes, especially dark vs light backgrounds.  Unfortunately
most vim colour schemes are geared towards specific colour
decisions.

Apart from a few rules, Agnostic tries not to force specific
colour choices and focusses on keeping readability over
a wide variety of choices.  This way, two or more people
can pair using vim over tmux and still use their own
preference for dark vs light themes.

Because Agnostic is meant to be used over tmux, it is a
colour xterm (cterm) only theme.  Users can set up their
colours in their terminal settings.  The rules for setting
up the colours are as follows.
