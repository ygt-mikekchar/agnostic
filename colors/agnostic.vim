let g:colors_name="agnostic"

" This scheme allows people to customize their colours in
" their terminals.  The colours should follow these rules.
"
" Background and Foreground Colours
"    0  - Normal Background Colour
"    15 - Normal Foreground Colour (i.e. text)
"
"    8 - Highlighted Background Colour
"    7 - Highlighted Foreground Colour
"
"    Colours 0 - 6  are background colours
"    Colours 9 - 15 are foreground colours
"
" Default Colour Hues are as follows.  The values
" on the left hand side are normal Xterm themes
" and the values on the right are solarized.
" See the section below for information on solarized
" compatibility.
"
"    For dark themes:
"    Default                Highlighted
"     0: Black, base02      8: Dark Grey,  base03
"    15: While, base3       7: Light Grey, base2
"
"    For light themes:
"    Default                Highlighted
"     0: White, base02      8: Light Grey, base03
"    15: Black, base3       7: Dark Grey,  base2
"
"    For all themes:
"     BG                    FG
"      1: Red,     red,      9: red      orange
"      2: Green,   green,   10: green    base01
"      3: Yellow,  yellow,  11: yellow   base00
"      4: Blue,    blue,    12: blue     base0
"      5: Magenta, magenta, 13: magenta  violet
"      6: Cyan,    cyan,    14: cyan     base1

" Colour mixing:
"   The following background/foreground combinations
"   are not allowed (because they clash in the default
"   colour hues):
"
"   - Any background with it's corresponding foreground
"     (e.g., 1 and 9, 2 and 10, etc)
"   - And combination of primary colour mixes
"     - Thus you can't mix Blue with Green or Red,
"       or Cyan with Magenta or Yellow, etc.
"   - Note that highlighting colours must be mixable
"   (i.e. 0 with 8 and 7 with 15)
"
" Font effects:
"   - Note that you should not mix effects because it is not
"     supported on most terminals.  So this means that
"     there should only be one thing after cterm=
"
"   - There are no italic effects because italics is not
"     supported on most terminals. Do not use cterm=italics
"
"   - To make some things stand out, occasionally it is useful
"     to put a background colour in the foreground and a foreground
"     colour in the background.  In this case put the foreground
"     colour in ctermfg and the background colour in ctermbg as
"     normal.  Then use cterm=reverse.  Note that this means you
"     can't use bold.
"
"  - To provide compatibility with Solarized, 8 is a background
"    colour and 7 is a foreground colour.  Thus, if you use colours
"    7 or 8, you must not use bold.
"
" Compatibility with Solarized
"   Keeping compatibility with solarized represents a challenge.
"   Solarized keeps the standard xterm hue settings for
"   the first 8 colours, but changes the second 8 colours to
"   shades of grey.  Since agnostic uses the second 8 colours
"   for foreground colours, this basically makes the agnostic
"   theme colourless when using a solarized colour palette.
"
"   Because compatibility with solarized is a very high priority,
"   I have tried to mix up some of the foreground and background
"   colours where it would improve readability for a solarized
"   palette and doesn't detract from the other supported
"   palettes.
"
"   Solarized is also a pain because in order to change the
"   theme from dark to light, they change the vim theme instead
"   of the palette.  This means that no matter whether you are
"   using a dark solarized palette or light solarized palette
"   with agnostic, it will always come out looking like the
"   solarized dark theme.  There is no way to fix this, unfortunately.
"
"   A very high priority is to create agnostic palettes that
"   mimic both dark and light solarized themes to an extent
"   that most solarized users will not be bothered by the
"   differences.  The current agnostic light and agnostic
"   dark themes are close but not perfect.
